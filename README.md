# Apollo Server Express
This is the simplest example of how to integrate Apollo Server on express

## Usage

- run `npm start`
- go to http://localhost:3000/ and you will a simple hello world
- go to http://localhost:3000/graphql and you will see the apollo server UI

I hope implement a more real example in order to get a background to migrate an existing app
